    "Understanding MAE in the Context of Basketball Shooting\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE is a metric that measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted values and actual values, without considering their direction. In our context, MAE is used to measure the difference between the shooting efficiencies of two players across various areas on the court.\n",
    "Step 1: Define Common Areas on the Court\n",
    "\n",
    "    The court is divided into different areas such as \"Left Corner 3,\" \"Top of Key,\" \"Paint,\" \"Mid-Range,\" etc.\n",
    "    For each player, their shot efficiency is calculated in these predefined areas. Shot efficiency is simply the ratio of successful shots to total attempts from that area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Calculate Individual Player Efficiencies\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each player, we fetch their shot data for a season and categorize their shots into these predefined areas.\n",
    "    We then calculate the shooting efficiency for each player in each of these areas. For example, Player A might have a 45% efficiency from \"Left Corner 3\" and 55% from \"Top of Key.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Identify Common Areas Between Players\n",
    "\n",
    "    When comparing two players, we first identify the common areas where both players have taken shots. This is crucial because MAE can only be calculated in areas where both players have data.\n",
    "    For example, if Player A and Player B both have shot data from \"Left Corner 3\" and \"Top of Key,\" these areas are considered common areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Calculate the MAE\n",
    "\n",
    "    For Each Common Area:\n",
    "        Calculate the absolute difference between Player A's efficiency and Player B's efficiency.\n",
    "        For example, if Player A has a 45% efficiency in \"Left Corner 3\" and Player B has 35%, the absolute difference is |45% - 35%| = 10%.\n",
    "    Overall MAE:\n",
    "        Sum up the absolute differences for all common areas and divide by the number of common areas to get the MAE. This gives an overall measure of how similar or different the players' shooting efficiencies are across the court.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Interpret the MAE for Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "    High MAE (More Compatibility):\n",
    "        A higher MAE indicates that the players excel in different areas of the court. For example, if Player A is highly efficient from \"Left Corner 3\" but not from \"Top of Key,\" while Player B is the opposite, the MAE between them will be high.\n",
    "        This is interpreted as more compatibility because the players complement each other by being good at different areas on the court, meaning they wonâ€™t crowd each other or compete for the same shots during a game.\n",
    "    Low MAE (Less Compatibility):\n",
    "        A lower MAE means the players have similar efficiencies in the same areas. This could indicate they are not as complementary because they might prefer shooting from the same spots, potentially leading to reduced spacing and efficiency when both are on the court together.\n",
    "        This is interpreted as less compatibility because both players might end up taking similar shots from the same areas, leading to potential redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Categorize Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "    Based on the calculated MAE, we can categorize the player pairings:\n",
    "        If the MAE is above a certain threshold (which could be the average MAE across all player pairs), the players are deemed \"Compatible.\"\n",
    "        If the MAE is below this threshold, they are deemed \"Not Compatible.\""
