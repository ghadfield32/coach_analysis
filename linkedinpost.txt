I'd love some help building a linked in post with actual examples of an app I created and the usecase I was trying to solve. 

goals:
Use a model to predict salary to get a generalized picture of the players so we can have predicted score rate how players are currently paid. We do trained this model with individual columns for positions and teams with injury mapping added as a masked 0 1 2 so we can have that context as well towards salary. I wanted this to only be a small part of the picture of a larger analysis tool that can help in trade scenarios, the predicted salary gets us a pool of the underpaid and over paid players in the league to have that box to check. The larger analysis shows how players change the count of each metrics percentile of the entire team compared to the average champion and how they change the statistics before and after trades with their percentile and in comparison to the overall percentile adjustment. Finally I added in a shot chart so we could figure out what players worked well together through MAE over the efficiencies in each section of the court. This shows when players shoot well in the same areas or different areas so we can better understand if a trade is a good idea. I added in the 6 years of data so we have 5 predicted on years that can be explored and trades seen at any date throughout for solid use case scenarios. the first solid example of this is the Dallas mavericks trade for daniel gafford for Richaun Holmes in 2/8/24 and pj washington for grant williams/seth curry on 2/8/24  to see how it affects their championship trajectory.
This shows that pj washington was more impactful in this trade scenario but ultimately both added key points for them to become more of a championship team as shown. daniel gafford added to their need for defense and made them more like the champions stl average count per percentile at 11 for the top 50%.
